Module_6_Challenge
completed weather data. 
vacation py had some challeges on it.  Asked TA for some help on the map and a question with the hotel. My hotels were running with names but not completly.  then when finish they were not running with hotel names. 
had to restart with a new API Key. 
wth the changes the TA helped me with hotel names disappear and after the new years nothing was running correctly.  Finaly after restarting and redoing everything I was able to complete the assignement.  Not sure there were some upgrades??
